# Project Overview

Cat Clicker is an online game that allows you to click on cats, and increase their counter. There are five cats to toggle between, each with their own counter. The application is a play on the 2010 Cow Clicker game by Ian Bogost.  https://www.cowclicker.com/.

The Cat Clicker application makes use of the Model, View, Octopus framework in order to manage separation of concerns. This application was created to be scalable, going from one cat to five cats.

# How to Use the Features

Pick A Cat: Click any of the 5 buttons at the top of the screen to toggle between cats.
Increment Counter: Click on the photo of the Cat to increment Counter.
Admin Panel: Click on the admin panel to update the click count, name or image of the cat selected.
